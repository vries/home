# From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15407075/how-could-i-use-git-bisect-to-find-the-first-good-commit#17153598
	bisect-fixed = bisect bad
        bisect-unfixed = bisect good

# From https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases:
	br = branch
	st = status

# The same linke suggests:
#       co = checkout
#       ci = commit
# but I find them confusing. For br and st, we use the first two letters as
# abbreviation. For commit, that is co, but that is used for checkout instead
# (obviously, to match the svn co abbreviation).
        ch = checkout

# Thought of my self:
	sti = status --ignored

	pick = cherry-pick
